    "# Astropy I: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have looked at some interesting features that Python and some of its packages have to offer. We had a glimpse of the power of NumPy and Matplotlib. These are perhaps very versatile packages and find use at a lot of places. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the scope for astronomical data analysis is very vast and is only getting wider with time. Since Python is the  primary programming language that many astronomers prefer, some went on to make packages relevant to astronomy. What if all such packages could be found together under one umbrella? Well, the **Astropy Project** is the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) is an open-source and community-developed Python package, with the first public version released in [2013](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2013/10/aa22068-13/aa22068-13.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Astropy is to provide core astronomy-related functionality to the community, including support for domain-specific file formats such as flexible image transport system (FITS) files, common ASCII table formats, unit and physical quantity conversions, physical constants specific to astronomy, celestial coordinate and time transformations, world coordinate system (WCS) support, generalized containers for representing gridded as well as tabular data, and a framework for cosmological transformations and conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To know more about Astropy, you can check out the latest documentation [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/)."

    "## Introduction to FITS files\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular file format used in astronomy, Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_documentation.html)), is a digital file format meant for storage of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (2D for the example we'll look at), or tables. Astropy provides the `astropy.io.fits` package to deal with FITS files efficiently and access information with ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "FITS files can also be used to store non-image data like (and this is foreshadowing) light curves or spectra in a table format. This particular application, we will see in the Scipy II tutorial. For the time being, we will concern ourselves only with image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with first importing this package."

It calculates the mean, median and standard deviation of the given data, then clips all the values beyond the mean $\\pm$ `sigma`times standard deviation, and then re-calculates the mean, median and standard deviation. This process is repeated until either the statistics converge, or for `iters` number of iterations. (`sigma` and `iters` are arguments to be passed to the function). <br>\n",

    "The FITS image we have used above was taken by the GROWTH-India Telescope, which uses a CCD camera. The dimensions of this camera are 4108x4096, indicating the number of individual pixels that collect data i.e. photons. CCDs are particularly popular because of their linear response to light, meaning that the reading of each pixel is essentially linearly proportional to the number of photons falling on this pixel. Hence, the array of numbers that is stored in a FITS file is basically a map of how many photons are incident on each pixel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the dark sky should give zero counts everywhere except where stars are present. However, we shall see in a the tutorial on **Image Reduction** that there are numerous sources of imperfections that make the analysis challenging. For now, let us accept those imperfections and try quantifying them. (We will also talk more about CCD cameras there as well)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you check the plots above and look at the regions which do not have any stars, you'll see that the color doesn't correspond to the zero value on the adjacent colorbar. This finite count which is more or less uniform everywhere is known as the background count. The sources for this count shall be discussed in a later tutorial."

    "You can use the features of the interactive plot in the matplotlib notebook environment, and find a region with low star counts. Try to do this for many regions, and find out if the values change considerably. \n",
    "2. Estimate the distribution of the background counts in the given image.<br>\n",
    "As you can imagine, the background rates are more or less random. However, they do follow some probability distribution. Your task is to numerically plot this distribution. Try to use only the parts of the image not containing the cluster. To help you out with this (quite new) concept, we have defined a dummy function below that can help you out.\n",
    "3. Try exploring the Astropy Table format (you can load ascii files with `astropy.io.ascii` much like we used `fits` here). We will come to this in a future tutorial, but it provides a way to deal with columns of different data types. Try to use this to replicate the previous assignments from Tutorials 1 and 3."

After our tutorial on Image Reduction, it might be interesting to use this software to process the image and get a pretty picture!"
